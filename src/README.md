I implemented a card matching game where the user will select two cards. If they are a match,
the cards will change there status and be highlighted green. If they are not a match, they will
highlight red and flip back over. The game can be reset at any point using the reset button.

The web service I used was a weather service from the OpenWeatherMap API. https://openweathermap.org/
